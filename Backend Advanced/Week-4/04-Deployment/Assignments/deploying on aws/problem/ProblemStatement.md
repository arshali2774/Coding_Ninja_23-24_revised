# Title: Deploying a Node.js Application on AWS

# Introduction + Scenario

In this coding challenge, you will take on the task of deploying a Node.js application onto the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. AWS, a leading cloud computing platform, offers a suite of services, including computing power, storage, and databases, making it a preferred choice for hosting and scaling web applications.

# Objective:

Your goal is to deploy the provided Node.js application on the AWS platform. Post deployment, insert the base URL of the application into the 'AWS_LINK' constant variable within the 'solution.js' file. Remember to include the entire base URL of the deployed application, such as "AWS_LINK=http://51.20.43.8:5000", with the appropriate http/https protocol.

# Expected Output:

Upon successful deployment, a GET request to the deployed link should yield a status code of 200, and the response data should be "Hurray! I have successfully deployed this application on AWS."
